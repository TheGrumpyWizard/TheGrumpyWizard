- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheGrumpyWizard
- 👀 I’m interested in Engineering, Food, Dungeons and Dragons, Art, and Artifice!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to illustrate in ProCreate, as well as how to start a business.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Embedded Systems projects (e.g. Wearables, IoT), robotics, and would eventually like to learn how to develop video games.
- 📫 You can reach me at thegrumpiestwizard@gmail.com, or @The.Grumpy.Wizard on Instagram.
